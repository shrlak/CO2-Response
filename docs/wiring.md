# Wiring

Default hardware: Arduino Uno + ADS1115 16-bit ADC breakout over I2C. Change `firmware/CO2Response/config.h` if yours differs.

## ADS1115 to Arduino

| ADS1115 | Arduino Uno / Nano | Arduino Mega |
| --- | --- | --- |
| VDD | 5V | 5V |
| GND | GND | GND |
| SCL | A5 (or the SCL pin) | 21 (SCL) |
| SDA | A4 (or the SDA pin) | 20 (SDA) |
| ADDR | GND (address 0x48) | GND |
| ALRT | not connected | not connected |

## Sensors to ADS1115

| ADS1115 input | Sensor | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A0 | Capnograph analog output | Add a 1 MΩ pull-up from A0 to VDD so an unplugged capnograph reads at the high rail and raises a technical alarm. |
| A1 | Flow sensor output | |
| A2 | Pneumotach pressure transducer output | Single-ended by default. |
| A3 | Spare, or the transducer's second output | Set `PNEUMO_DIFFERENTIAL 1` to read A2–A3 differentially. |

## Rules

- **Common ground.** Sensor grounds, ADC ground and Arduino ground must be joined. Most noise and offset problems are a missing ground.
- **Stay inside the input range.** With a 5 V supply no input may go below −0.3 V or above 5.3 V. If a sensor can output more than VDD, use a resistor divider and put the divider ratio into the calibration.
- **Match the PGA gain to the sensors.** `GAIN_TWOTHIRDS` (±6.144 V full scale) suits 0–5 V sensors. For 0–3.3 V sensors use `GAIN_ONE` (±4.096 V) for more resolution, and update `railHighV` in `web/public/config/channels.json`.
- **Pneumotach leads.** Use twisted or shielded wire between the pressure transducer and the ADC, and keep it away from pump or heater wiring.
- **Electrical isolation.** If anything is connected to a person or animal, power the setup from a battery laptop or through a medical-grade USB isolator. See [safety.md](safety.md).

## Checking the wiring

1. Flash the firmware and open the dashboard. If the header never shows a sample rate and **Settings > Diagnostics** shows `E,ADC_NOT_FOUND`, the ADC is not answering on I2C: check power, SDA/SCL and the ADDR pin.
2. In **Settings > Display & units**, turn on **Show raw volts** to see each channel's voltage under its number.
3. A channel pinned at 0 V or 5 V for 2 s raises an "AT ADC RAIL" technical alarm (CO2 only at 5 V).
